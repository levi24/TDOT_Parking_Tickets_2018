# Breakdown of Population Based on Age Groups in Toronto

This repository shows a detail view of the work in retrieving data from opendatatoronto. The dataset provides data for the census of the population in 140 neighbourhoods in Toronto. Though the dataset is quite large, the code in "total_population.Rmd" filters the dataet and focuses on the city of Toronto as a whole. The data pinpoints the total population of each age group, ranging from Children to Older Seniors.
